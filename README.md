# Funkin' 4 r/place
An r/place mod for Friday Night Funkin'.

## Download & Play
* itch.io - TBD
* [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/444552)
* GameJolt - TBD

## Building
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/) (*not* Haxe 4.1.5!)

Then, run the following:
```
haxelib install lime
haxelib update lime
haxelib install openfl
haxelib update openfl
haxelib install flixel 5.2.2
haxelib intstall flixel-addons 3.0.2
haxelib run lime setup flixel
haxelib install newgrounds
haxelib update newgrounds
haxelib run flixel-tools setup
haxelib run lime setup
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
haxelib git hscript https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript
haxelib git hscript-ex https://github.com/ianharrigan/hscript-ex
```

(At the moment, you need to also run `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/nebulazorua/linc_luajit`)

If you get an error about StatePointer (or anything else really) when using Lua, run haxelib remove linc_luajit into Command Prompt/PowerShell, then re-install linc_luajit.

When it asks you for your IDE, you can pick your actual IDE (or, if you don't know / can't identify it, choose `4`). Say yes to adding `flixel` and `lime` as commands.

Then:

**For our charters! Add `-debug` to all of these commands**
* If you're building for HTML5, run `lime test html5`
* If you're building for Mac, run `lime test mac`
* If you're building for Linux, run `lime test linux`
* If you're building for Windows, keep reading

If you're building for Windows, download [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) ([try this link if the other one doesn't work](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads)). While installing, **do not choose any option to install workloads**. 

Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:
* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)

This will take up about 4GB of storage. Once that's done, you can run `lime test windows`. **For our charters! Run `lime test windows -debug` instead**

#### Android
(NOTE: Android support is currently experimental and has not been tested on an actual device yet)

All credit to the [Funkin-android repository](https://github.com/luckydog7/Funkin-android) for the entire tutorial.

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html), and the [Android NDK (r15c)](https://github.com/android/ndk/wiki/Unsupported-Downloads#r15c). Install Android Studio and the JDK, and unzip the Android NDK somewhere in your computer.

2. In Android Studio, go to Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK. Install Android 4.4 (KitKat), Android SDK Build-Tools, and Android SDK Platform-Tools.

3. In the Command Prompt (or the Terminal), run `lime setup android`. Insert the corresponding file paths. Your Android SDK should be located in `C:\Users\*username*\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk`, and your Java JDK in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_331`.

4. Run `lime build android -debug` (remove "-debug" for official releases) to build the APK. The APK will be located inside your source code directory in `export\(debug or release)\android\bin\app\build\outputs\apk`. If you have a device emulator running in Android Studio, you can instead do `lime test android` to open it in the emulator.
